# ELRYNE_SIAACTIVITY

I don’t really know much about System Integration and Architecture, but I think it will teach me how different systems or parts of technology can work together. At first, the subject sounds a bit confusing, but I expect that I will slowly understand as we go on.

I think it might be challenging because connecting systems is not always easy, but I want to learn how to solve those problems. I also expect that this subject will give me more ideas on how IT works in the real world.

I just want to learn something new and useful from this subject, even if at the start I don’t fully understand it. Hopefully, it will help me build more knowledge for my future in IT.
